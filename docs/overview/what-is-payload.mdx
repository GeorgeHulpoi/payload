Payload is the Next.js fullstack framework. Write a Payload config and instantly get:

- A full admin panel using React server / client components, matching the shape of your data
- Automatic database schema, including direct DB access and ownership, with migrations, transactions, proper indexing, and more
- REST, GraphQL, and straight-to-DB Node APIs
- Authentication which can be used in your own apps
- A deeply customizable access control pattern
- File storage and image management tools like cropping / focal point selection
- Live preview - see your frontend render content changes in realtime as you update
- Lots more

You can install Payload into any existing Next.js app in a single line and deploy it right alongside of your frontend on serverless platforms like Vercel.

No matter what you're building, Payload will give you backend superpowers. It can be installed in one line into any existing Next.js app and is designed to catapult your development process. Payload takes the most complex and time-consuming parts of any modern web app and makes them simple. 

Even in spite of how much you get out of the box, you still have full control over every aspect of your app - be it database, admin UI, or anything else. Every part of Payload is open-source and has been designed to be extensible and customizable with modern TypeScript / React. And you'll fully understand the code that you write.

In Payload, there are no "click ops" - as in clicking around in an admin panel to define your schema. In Payload, everything is done the right wayâ€”code-first and version controlled like a proper backend. But once developers define how Payload should work, non-technical users can independently make use of its admin panel to manage whatever they need to do without having to know code whatsoever.

## Use cases

Payload started as a headless Content Management System (CMS), but since, we've seen our community leverage Payload in ways far outside of simply managing pages and blog posts. It's grown into a full-stack TypeScript app framework. 

Large enterprises use Payload to power significant internal tools, retailers power their entire storefronts without the need for headless Shopify, and massive amounts of digital assets are stored + managed within Payload. Of course, websites large and small still use Payload for content management as well.

#### As a CMS

The biggest barrier in large web projects cited by marketers is engineering. Conversely, engineers say the opposite. This points to a contentious problem that has yet to be solved even though we have countless CMS options.

Payload has restored a little love back into that equation with features like Live Preview, redirects, form builders, visual editing, static A/B testing, and more. But even with all this focus on marketing efficiency, we aren't compromising on the developer experience. That way engineers and marketers alike can be proud of the products they build.

If you're building a website and your frontend is on Next.js, then Payload is a no-brainer. Instead of going out and signing up for a SaaS vendor that makes it so you have to manage two completely separate concerns, with little to no native connection back and forth, just install Payload in your existing Next.js repo and instantly get a full CMS.

#### Enterprise applications

#### Headless commerce

#### Digital asset management


### When Payload might be for you

- If data ownership and privacy are important to you, and you don't want to allow another proprietary SaaS vendor to host and own your data
- If you're building a Next.js site that needs a CMS
- If you need to re-use your data outside of a SaaS API
- If what you're building has custom business logic requirements outside of a typical headless CMS
- You want to deploy serverless on platforms like Vercel

### When Payload might not be for you

- If you can manage your project fully with code, and don't need an admin UI
- If you are building a website that fits within the limits a tool like Webflow or Framer
- If you already have a full database and just need to visualize the data somehow 
- If you are confident that you won't need code / data ownership at any point in the future
